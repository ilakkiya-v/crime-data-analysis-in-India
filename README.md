# crime-data-analysis-in-India
With the rapid improvement of lifestyle and urbanization, the graph of crimes is also on the increase.  As the report says that India has high illiteracy rate, high population density, low job opportunities, these have become one of the reasons for high crime rate in India. Due to different problems in every state, different states have different crime rate.  In this project, we analyze the patterns of crime performed on a dataset with demographic information of crime in India(District-Wise).
